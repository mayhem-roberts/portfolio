            <p>Hello, I’m Meagan Roberts I grew up in Idaho. I’m looking for a career opportunity in Web development that would also utilize my skills as a graphic designer. I attended Brigham Young University of Idaho where I studied Applied Technology, this included frontend and backend web development, computer programing, computer support, and graphic design. I’m a creative person with great attention to detail. I worked in the design industry for a few years as a florist, there I worked closely with clients to understand their vision and then carry it out. I have worked in team settings many times and do well with collaborative work. I recently developed an app with a former classmate called Pocket Pantry. I mainly managed the frontend development and GUI design, while also assisting with database and backend structure.</p>
